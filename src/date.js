    details: `Gunther is one of the most destructive heavyweights to ever set foot in a WWE ring.

    Ushered to the ring as Dvořák's powerful “Symphony No. 9” echoes through the arena, Gunther inspires fear in his opponents before he even steps through the ropes, and for good reason.
    
    An active competitor for more than a decade, Gunther became a breakout star on the independent circuit in Europe and beyond. He's feared around the world for his pulverizing in-ring style, including brutal knife-edge chops that leave opponents' chests sunken and discolored. Gunther stands 6-foot-4 and tips the scales at around 300 pounds.`,

    Andrade's inherent skill for the family trade was unmistakable from the moment he debuted at age 13. He first established himself in his native Mexico and Japan, capturing championships in both countries. In WWE under the direction of Zelina Vega, Andrade used uncanny speed and ring awareness to ascend to the top of the black-and-gold brand when he captured the NXT Championship at NXT TakeOver: WarGames in 2017.`,

      A standout in the WWE Performance Center and the Mae Young Classic, Rhea Ripley entered NXT UK already a seasoned and cutthroat grappler with one goal on her mind, to rip the NXT UK Women's division apart.
      
      The ultra-aggressive and terrifyingly strong Aussie embraced her true self, and that has spelled bad news for anyone who faces her, as she already had the physical goods to stand toe-to-toe with any Superstar in sports-entertainment.`,

The brothers repeatedly took to the skies in bright colors, flying tassels and dazzling war paint, winning the WWE Tag Team Championship and Slammy for Tag Team of the Year on more than one occasion. 

    But eventually faced with a crop of new tag teams to overcome, The Usos soon decided they were “done with all that” and went back to basics. No more paint, no more screaming. Black T-shirt, black hoodies and a mean streak that needs to be seen to be believed.`,

    The results speak for themselves. Lynch gave the Women's division a shot in the arm in 2018 when she won her second SmackDown Women's Championship, leading an invasion of Raw that left Ronda Rousey demoralized and humiliated — this despite Becky suffering a concussion in the process.`,

As a member of SmackDown, Liv realized her lifelong dream of becoming a Superstar, a goal that took root in a makeshift ring that she and her brothers constructed in their family’s backyard in New Jersey.

    A former competitive cheerleader, Liv boasts a combination of agility and creativity once the bell rings, but she’s not afraid to scrap, either. Looking to make her friends and family back in the 201 area code proud, Liv represents New Jersey to the fullest and refuses to back down from a fight.`,

Green made a surprise return in the 2023 Royal Rumble Match and immediately took the WWE Universe by storm. Whether it's berating Adam Pearce or her opponents in the ring, Green has made a habit of having the last word since joining the red brand.
    
    With a laundry list of perceived slights always at the ready, Green found a kindred spirit in Sonya Deville. The two would go on to win the WWE Women's Tag Team Titles by defeating Liv Morgan & Raquel Rodriguez on the July 17, 2023 episode of Raw.`,

      Punk even looks the part of rebel with his too-numerous-to-count tattoos and body piercings. Yet, he waxes way more philosophical than his exterior might have suggested and showed a diverse set of interests that included ghost hunting, G.I. Joe and the “Straight Edge” movement, a subculture that rejects the use of drugs, alcohol and a dependency lifestyle.`,

If you really can't see John Cena at this point, chances are you simply aren't looking.

    Was there any doubt Cena would become the living legend he is today? You practically knew you were glimpsing the future “Face That Runs the Place” when a muscular Massachusetts kid threw down with Kurt Angle for a chance to become a true WWE Superstar.

    After an unexpected departure ended his first WWE run in 2014, McIntyre emerged back on the scene in 2017 and quickly rose to unprecedented heights. “The Scottish Warrior” came back bigger and badder than ever, riding a wave of momentum all the way to the main event of WrestleMania 36, where he defeated Brock Lesnar to capture his first WWE Championship.`,

    The WWE Universe may know Bálor for being the first-ever Universal Champion, but the mysterious Irishman’s legend spanned across countries and continents long before he ever stepped onto the WWE stage. After competing in his first match at 18 and achieving success in his homeland, Bálor relocated to Japan to hone his skills in the notorious dojo system of the Far East. Unsurprisingly, he thrived, winning multiple championships and leading several foot soldiers to support him. He soon relocated to America to ply his trade in NXT, where he achieved a record-setting run with the NXT Championship, among other accolades.`,
